# minecraft_resource_tree

App to help with crafting trees and resources management.

Inspired by the emi mod, and it's craft trees. The app aims at adding functionnality to emi, and might be translated to an actual minecraft mod, possibly emi addon, which would be infinitely better.

However, I don't know minecraft modding but I know Rust and so I do rust.

## TODOs
Optimisations:
* Item bank (centralised item storage, access with unique ID)
* Async solve
